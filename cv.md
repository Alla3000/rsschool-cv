## About myself

*For the past five years, I have been teaching programming to students. My dream is to change my field of activity to IT. Working as a teacher gave me the ability to find an approach to different people and to control myself in any situation. Of course, self-education is part of my daily life. In addition, my little daughter is my incentive to achieve something in this life. I like learning something new every day. And the repetition of the same material from year to year for students has become boring. I want to see and overcome new peaks.*
