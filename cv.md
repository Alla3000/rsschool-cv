## About myself

*For the past five years, I have been teaching programming to students. My dream is to change my field of activity to IT. Working as a teacher gave me the ability to find an approach to different people and to control myself in any situation. Of course, self-education is part of my daily life. In addition, my little daughter is my incentive to achieve something in this life. I like learning something new every day. And the repetition of the same material from year to year for students has become boring. I want to see and overcome new peaks.*

## Code example

**Squares sequence from codewars:** *Complete the function that returns an array of length n, starting with the given number x and the squares of the previous number. If n is negative or zero, return an empty array/list.*
```
function solution(number){
  let answer=0;
  while (number>=3)
    { number--;
      if ((number%3==0)||(number%5==0)) answer+=number;
    }
  return answer;
}
```
